# Goodreads-Checkout
Pick random books 

Goodreads-Checkout depends on Requests (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) which can be installed from the command line using "pip install requests" without quotes.
To use the program you also need to input your Goodreads API key which you can request from the Goodreads website as well as your user id.
This program is designed to be used with the Pasco Library System but could be adapted to be used with other online library catalogues.

Goodreads-Checkout randomly searches for books from your Goodreads "to-read" list until it reaches a page total and opens up the appropriate Pasco County Library catalogue page.

Depends on Requests (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) which can be installed with the command "pip install requests"

You must request a Goodreads API key and write it and your user id into the program. 

Currently the program only works for the Pasco County Library system in Florida, but could be adapted for most other library systems.
